	"GML: Generalized Markup Language - Generalized Markup Language (GML) is a set of macros (tags) for the IBM text formatter, \"SCRIPT\". SCRIPT is the main component of IBM's Document Composition Facility (DCF). GML simplifies the description of a document in terms of its format, organization structure and content parts and their relationship, and other properties. GML markup (or tags) describe such parts as chapters, important sections, and less important sections (by specifying heading levels), paragraphs, lists, tables, and so forth. Using GML, a document is marked up with tags that define what the text is, in terms of paragraphs, headers, lists, tables, and so forth. The document can then be automatically formatted for various devices simply by specifying a profile for the device. For example, it is possible to format a document for a laser printer or a line (dot matrix) printer or for a screen simply by specifying a profile for the device without changing the document itself.",

	"Inline Expansion - Inline expansion or inlining for short is a compiler optimization which \"expands\" a function call site into the actual implementation of the function which is called, rather than each call transferring control to a common piece of code. This reduces overhead associated with the function call, which is especially important for small and frequently called functions, and it helps call-site-specific compiler optimizations, especially constant propagation. The main drawback is that the expansion usually results in a larger binary code, which can actually hurt performance if it damages locality of reference or exceeds resource constraints.",

People can execute the same source code either directly by an interpreter or by compiling it and then executing the machine code produced later. It takes longer to run a program under an interpreter than to run the compiled code but it can take less time to interpret it than the total time required to compile and run it. This is especially important when prototyping and testing code when an edit-interpret-debug cycle can often be much shorter than an edit-compile-run-debug cycle.",

	"IR: Information Retrieval - Information retrieval (IR) is the science of searching for information in documents, searching for documents themselves, searching for metadata which describes documents, or searching within databases, whether relational stand-alone databases or hypertext networked databases such as the Internet or intranets, for text, sound, images or data. There is a common confusion, however, between data retrieval, document retrieval, information retrieval, and text retrieval, and each of these has their own bodies of literature, theory, praxis and technologies.",
	"IRC Bot: Internet Relay Chat Bot - Internet Relay Chat (IRC) bot is a set of scripts or an independent program that connects to Internet Relay Chat as a client, and so appears to other IRC users as another user. It differs from a regular client in that instead of providing interactive access to IRC for a human user, it performs automated functions. Often, an IRC bot is deployed as a detached program running from a stable host. It sits on an IRC channel to keep it open and prevents malicious users from taking over the channel. It can be configured to give channel operator status to privileged users when they join the channel, and can provide a unified channel operator list. An IRC bot can also perform many other useful functions, such as logging what happens in an IRC channel, giving out information on demand (very popular in IRC channels dealing with user support), creating statistics, hosting trivia games, and so on.",
	"ISA: Instruction Set Architecture - Instruction set architecture, also known as instruction set, is the part of the computer architecture related to programming, including the native data types, instructions, registers, addressing modes, memory architecture, interrupt and exception handling, and external I/O. An ISA includes a specification of the set of opcodes (machine language), the native commands implemented by a particular CPU design.",
	"IT Management: Information Technology Management - Information technology management (IT management), also called Management of Information Systems (MIS), is a combination of two branches: information technology and management. One implies the management of a collection of systems, infrastructure, and information that resides in them. Another implies the management of information technologies as a business function. This aims at achieving the goals and objectives of an organisation through computers.",
	"IT: Information Technology - Information Technology (IT) is a broad subject concerned with technology and other aspects of managing and processing information, especially in large organizations. In particular, IT deals with the use of electronic computers and computer software to convert, store, protect, process, transmit, and retrieve information. For that reason, computer professionals are often called IT specialists or Business Process Consultants, and the division of a company or university that deals with software technology is often called the IT department. Other names for the latter are information services (IS) or management information services (MIS), managed service providers (MSP).",
	"ITS: Incompatible Time-Sharing System - Incompatible time-sharing System(ITS) is operating system written for the DEC PDP-6 and PDP-10 at MIT and long used at the MIT AI Lab. ITS pioneered many important innovations, including transparent file sharing between machines and terminal-independent I/O. After about 1982, most actual work was shifted to newer machines, with the remaining ITS boxes run essentially as a hobby and service to the hacker community.",
	"IZArc - IZArc is a freeware file archiver for Microsoft Windows. It handles a great variety of archive formats, including some of the commonly used ones like zip, rar, gzip, bzip2, and 7z.One distinguishing feature of IZArc is the ability to convert an archive from one format to another format.",
	"J2EE: Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition - Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition (J2EE), now called Java Platform, Enterprise Editor(Java EE), is a programming platformâ€”part of the Java Platformâ€”for developing and running distributed multitier architecture Java applications, based largely on modular software components running on an application server. The Java EE platform is defined by a specification. Similar to other Java Community Process specifications, Java EE is also considered informally to be a standard because providers must agree to certain conformance requirements in order to declare their products as Java EE compliant; albeit with no ISO or ECMA standard.",
	"JACK Audio Connection Kit - The JACK Audio Connection Kit (JACK) is a soundserver or daemon that provides low latency connections between so-called jackified applications. It is created by Paul Davis and others and licensed under the GPL. JACK is free audio software. It can use ALSA, PortAudio and (still experimental) OSS as its back-end. As of 2003 it runs on GNU / Linux and Mac OS X.",
	"JADE Programming Language - JADE is an object-oriented programming language that exhibits a seamlessly integrated object-oriented database management system. It is designed to be an end-to-end development environment, which allows systems to be coded in one language from the database server at one end down to the clients at the other."
