	"Multitasking - In computing, multitasking is technique used in an operating system for sharing a single processor between several independent jobs. In the case of a computer with a single CPU, only one task is said to be running at any point in time, meaning that the CPU is actively executing instructions for that task. Multitasking solves the problem by scheduling which task may be the one running at any given time, and when another waiting task gets a turn. The act of reassigning a CPU from one task to another one is called a context switch. When context switches occur frequently enough the illusion of parallelism is achieved. Even on computers with more than one CPU, multitasking allows many more tasks to be run than there are CPUs.",

This is accomplished by sharing as much as possible of the program execution environment between the different threads so that very little state needs to be saved and restored when changing thread. Multiple threads can be executed in parallel on many computer systems. This multithreading generally occurs by time slicing, wherein a single processor switches between different threads--in which case the processing is not literally \"simultaneous\", for the single processor is only really doing one thing at a time. On a multiprocessor system, threading can be achieved via multiprocessing, wherein different threads can run simultaneously on different processors.",

One can only describe a database as having a normal form if the relationships between quantities have been rigorously defined. It is possible to use set theory to express this knowledge once a problem domain has been fully understood, but most database designers model the relationships in terms of an \"idealized schema\".",
	"NLP: Natural Language Processing - Natural language processing(NLP) refers to the computer understanding, analysis, manipulation, and/or generation of natural language. NLP is a subfield of artificial intelligence and linguistics. It studies the problems of automated generation and understanding of natural human languages. Natural language generation systems convert information from computer databases into normal-sounding human language, and natural language understanding systems convert samples of human language into more formal representations that are easier for computer programs to manipulate.",
	"No-CD Crack - A No-CD crack is a special computer program used to play computer games without having to insert the CD-ROM.This act is a form of software cracking. No-CD cracks can be found on the Internet from many websites or other various filesharing networks.",
	"Nodezilla - Nodezilla is a peer-to-peer network software written in C++ and Java, released under the GNU General Public License. Technically, Nodezilla is a secured, distributed and fault-tolerant routing system (aka Grid network). Its main purpose is to serve as a link for distributed services built on top of it (like chat, efficient video multicasting streaming, File Sharing, secured file store.",
	"Non-code resource - Non-code resource is a resource containing the data structures on which the program operates, for example, 'WIND', 'DLOG', 'DITL', or 'SIZE' resources. The resource compiler Rez or a resource editor may be used to create non-code resources.",
	"Non-compressed sound data - Non-compressed sound data is the sampled-sound data that has not been subjected to audio compression or that has been decompressed.",
	"Nonlinear Programming - In mathematics, nonlinear programming (NLP) is the process of solving a system of equalities and inequalities over a set of unknown real variables, along with an objective function to be maximized or minimized.",
	"Non-Printable Character - Non-Printable Character is a character that doesn't have a corresponding character letter to its corresponding ASCII code. Examples would be the Linefeed, which is ASCII character code 10 decimal, the Carriage Return, which is 13 decimal, or the bell sound, which is decimal 7. On a PC, you can often add non-printable characters by holding down the Alt key, and typing in the decimal value. There are other character encoding schemes, but ASCII is the most prevalent.",
	"Non-Proprietary Software - Non-proprietary software, the opposite of proprietary software, refers to the software that has no proprietary restrictions attached to it, particularly the restriction about the access to the source code. Proprietary software is software where the source code has not been made available, or it is protected by restrictive licensing clauses. Non-proprietary software is not a widely used term and has no generally accepted definition. It is sometimes used as an umbrella term for the many alternative terms for free software.Â ",
	"Nonrelocatable Block - Nonrelocatable block is a block whose location in the heap is fixed. This block can't be moved during heap compaction or other memory operations.",
	"NonStop SQL - NonStop SQL is a relational database product originally produced at Tandem Computers using the pioneering Ingres source code from University of California, Berkeley. NonStop is the \"brand name\" for Tandem's suite of high-availabiliy products, a brand that survived Tandem's takeover by Compaq, and today after Compaq's takeover by HP.",
	"Nonvolatile Register - Nonvolatile register is a register whose contents must be preserved across subroutine calls. If a routine changes the value of a nonvolatile register, it must save the old value on the stack before changing the register and restore that value before returning.",
	"Normalization in Database - IIn relational databases, normalization is a process that eliminates redundancy, organizes data efficiently, reduces the potential for anomalies during data operations and improves data consistency. The formal classifications used for quantifying \"how normalized\" a relational database is are called normal forms.",
