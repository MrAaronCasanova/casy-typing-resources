Used originally in the OS/2 and Microsoft Windows operating systems, parts of the CUA standard are now implemented in programs for other operating systems, including variants of Unix. Java AWT and Swing use it as well. The CUA contains standards for the operation of dialog boxes, menus and keyboard shortcuts. For example, in programs written to the CUA standard, help is always summoned by pressing the F1 function key. New programs should be easier to use because users will not have to learn new commands to perform standard tasks.",

The formal classifications used for quantifying \"how normalized\" a relational database is are called normal forms. A non-normalized database is vulnerable to data anomalies because it stores data redundantly.

Source code for Deflate compression and decompression can be found in zlib, the freely available, general-purpose compression library.",
	"Defragment - Defragment is a process often required in a computer system to reorganize the disk by putting files into contiguous order. Because the operating system stores new data in whatever free space is available, data files become spread out across the disk as they are updated.

The paradigm of a latent operating system flaw is time slice multiplexing in Microsoft operating systems pre-dating OS2 and Windows NT. With time slicing, a rogue or buggy program can effectively disable the entire computer, forcing the user to hard boot the machine.",
	"DLL: Dynamic-Link Library - Dynamic-link library (DLL) is Microsoft's implementation of the shared library concept in the Microsoft Windows operating systems. These libraries usually have the file extension DLL, OCX (for libraries containing ActiveX controls), or DRV (for legacy system drivers). The file formats for DLLs are the same as for Windows EXE files that is, Portable Executable (PE) for 32-bit Windows, and New Executable (NE) for 16-bit Windows. DLLs can contain code, data, and resources, in any combination. DLL is files containing groups of often-used computer code which can be shared amongst many programs. This has several advantages: programmers who use library code do not need to keep reinventing the wheel; programs which invoke library code do not each need to include a copy of that code, making their files smaller; updates to library code can be applied in one place, rather than in many programs.",
	"DM: Data Mart - Data mart (DM) is a specialized version of a data warehouse (DW). Whereas a data warehouse combines databases across an entire enterprise, data marts are usually smaller and focus on a particular subject or department. Data marts contain a snapshot of operational data that helps business people to strategize, based on analyses of past trends and experiences. Since a data mart configuration emphasizes easy access to relevant information, the star schema or dimensional model is a fairly popular design choice, as it enables a relational database to emulate the analytical functionality of a multi-dimensional database.",
	"DM: Data Mining - Data mining (DM), also known as Knowledge-Discovery in Databases (KDD) or Knowledge-Discovery and Data Mining (KDD), is the process of automatically searching large volumes of data for patterns. Data mining uses automated data analysis techniques to uncover previously undetected relationships among data items. Data mining often involves the analysis of data stored in a data warehouse. Three of the major data mining techniques are regression, classification and clustering.",
	"DML: Data Manipulation Language - Data Manipulation Language (DML) is a family of computer languages used by computer programs or database users to retrieve, insert, delete and update data in a database. The currently most popular Data manipulation language is that of SQL, which is used to retrieve and manipulate data in a Relational database. Other forms of DML are those used by IMS/DL1, CODASYL databases (such as IDMS), and others.",
	"DMX: Data Mining Extensions - Data Mining Extensions (DMX) is a query language for Data Mining Models, much like that SQL is a query language for relational databases and MDX is a query language for OLAP databases. DMX syntax is more similar to SQL than MDX.",
	"Doc-O-Matic - Doc-O-Matic is a commercial automatic documentation generator that creates fully cross linked documentation systems, including both Source Code Documentation, Online Help and User Manuals in PDF, browser-based Help, HTML Help, MS Help 2, Windows Help, RTF and XML. Doc-O-Matic supports all major project file formats as well as the following programming languages: C/C++, C++/CLI, C#, Delphi, Java, IDL, VB.NET, JavaScript, MATLAB, ASP.NET, JSP.",
	"Document! X - Document! X is a documentation generator which automates technical documentation production for VB6/VBA source code, C#/VB.NET/C++ or other .NET language assemblies, databases, COM components, type libraries and XSD schemas. Document! X consists of an authoring and documentation built environment (including HTML based Visual Authoring tools) as well as Visual Comment Editor Add-Ins for Visual Basic, VBA and Visual Studio .NET."
