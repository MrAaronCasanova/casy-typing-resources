	"Java Bytecode - Java bytecode is the form of instructions that the Java virtual machine executes. Each bytecode instruction is one byte in length (hence the name), thus the number of bytecodes is limited to no more than 256. Not all 256 possible bytecode values are used, in fact Sun Microsystems, the original creators of the Java programming language, the Java virtual machine and other components of the Java Runtime Environment, have set aside a number of values to be permanently unimplemented. A Java programmer does not need to be aware of or understand Java bytecode at all. However, Understanding bytecode and what bytecode is likely to be generated by a Java compiler helps the Java programmer in the same way that knowledge of assembler helps the C or C++ programmer.",

Legacy systems are considered to be potentially problematic for several reasons. Legacy systems often run on obsolete (and usually slow) hardware, and sometimes spare parts for such computers become increasingly difficult to obtain. These systems are often hard to maintain, improve, and expand because there is a general lack of understanding of the system. The designers of the system may have left the organization, leaving no one left to explain how it works.

	"Logic Programming - Logic programming (sometimes called logical programming) is programming that makes use of pattern-directed invocation of procedures from assertions and goals. The first logic programming language was Planner which featured pattern-directed invocation of procedural plans from both assertions and goals. In order to cope with the very limited memory systems that were available when it was developed, Planner used backtracking control structure so that only one possible computation path had to be stored at a time. Subsequently, Prolog was developed as a simplification of Planner that had pattern-directed invocation only from goals (also based on backtracking). From Planner there developed the programming languages QA-4, Popler, Conniver, and QLISP. The programming languages Mercury, Visual Prolog, Oz and Fril developed from Prolog.

	"Loop Interchange - Loop interchange, a compiler optimization technique, is the process of exchanging the order of two iteration variables. One major purpose of loop interchange is to improve the cache performance for accessing array elements. Cache misses occur if the contiguously accessed array elements within the loop come from a different cache line. Loop interchange can help prevent this. The effectiveness of loop interchange depends on and must be considered in light of the cache model used by the underlying hardware and the array model used by the compiler.",
	"Loop Inversion - Loop inversion is a technique in compiler optimization, particularly in loop transformation. This technique changes a standard while loop into a do/while (a.k.a. repeat/until) loop wrapped in an if conditional, reducing the number of jumps by two, for cases when the loop is executed. Doing so duplicates the condition check (increasing the size of the code) but is more efficient because jumps usually cause a pipeline stall. Additionally, if the initial condition is known at compile-time and is known to be side-effect-free, the \"if\" guard can be skipped.",

Loop tiling partitions a loop’s iteration space into smaller chunks or blocks, so as to help ensure that data used in a loop stays in the cache until it is reused. The partitioning of loop iteration space leads to partitioning of large array into smaller blocks, thus fitting accessed array elements into cache size, enhancing cache reuse and eliminating cache size requirements.",
	"Loop Transformation - Loop transformation refers to a group of loop optimization techniques in computer programming and compiling, which plays an important role in improving cache performance and effective use of parallel processing capabilities. Common loop transformations include: - loop interchange - loop splitting/Loop peeling - loop fusion - loop fission - loop unrolling - loop tiling/loop blocking - loop skewing - loop inversion - loop-invariant code motion - vectorization - parallelization",
	"Loop Unswitching - Loop unswitching is a compiler optimization technique. It moves a conditional inside a loop outside of it by duplicating the loop's body, and placing a version of it inside each of the \"if and else\" clauses of the conditional. This can improve the parallization of the loop. Since modern processors can operate fast on vectors this increases the speed.",
	"Loop Unwinding - Loop unwinding, also known as loop unrolling, is a technique for optimizing parts of computer programs. The idea is to save time by reducing the number of overhead instructions that the computer has to execute in a loop, and thus improving the cache hit rate and reducing branching. To achieve this, the instructions that are called in multiple iterations of the loop are combined into a single iteration. This will speed up the program if the overhead instructions of the loop impair performance significantly.",
	"Loop-Invariant Code Motion - Loop-invariant code motion is a compiler optimization technique which performs loop-invariant code movement automatically to improve execution speed. Loop-invariant code in an imperative programming language consists of statements which could be moved to before the loop (if the loop always terminates), or after the loop, without affecting the semantics of the program. As a result, it is executed less often.",
	"Low-Level Language - Low-level programming language is a type of computer language that provides little or no abstraction from a computer's microprocessor. The word \"low\" refers to the small or nonexistent amount of abstraction between the language and machine language, it is therefore often described as machine-oriented languages. They cannot easily be converted to run on a computer with a different central processing unit, and they are relatively difficult to learn because a detailed knowledge of the internal working of the computer is required. Since they must be translated into machine code by an assembler program, low-level languages are also called assembly languages. \"High-level\" and \"low-level\" are also used relatively, so a Java programmer might consider C to be a comparatively low-level language.  ",
	"LSM: Linux Software Map - Linux Software Map (LSM) is a standard text format for describing Linux software. LSM for a program is a single text document, named software_package_name.lsm. An LSM begins with Begin4 and ends with End. It has one field on each line. Field name is separated from value by a \": \". Mandatory fields are Title, Version, Entered-date, Description, Author and Primary-site.",
	"LURCH - LURCH is a software design debugging tool that uses a nondeterministic algorithm to quickly explore the reachable states of a software model. By performing a partial and random search, LURCH looks for faults in the model and reports the pathways leading to the faults.",
	"LWP: Light-Weight Process - In computer operating systems, a light-weight process (LWP), confusingly known as a kernel thread, is a means of achieving multitasking. In contrast to a user thread, which is handled at the application level, a light-weight process is scheduled by the kernel. For this reason, they are generally preferred over a userland thread implementation whenever possible, as there is usually much less overhead. LWP is a single-threaded sub-process which, unlike a thread, has its own process identifier and may also differ in its inheritance and controlling features. ",
	"LZO: Lempel-Ziv-Oberhumer - Lempel-Ziv-Oberhumer (LZO) is a data compression algorithm that is focused on decompression speed. The algorithm is lossless and the source is thread safe. A free software tool which implements the LZO algorithm is lzop. The original library was written in ANSI C, and it has been made available under the GNU General Public License. Versions of LZO are available for the Perl, Python and Java languages.",
	"Mac OS X - Mac OS X is the tenth and the latest version of the Macintosh operating system, and is designed and developed by Apple Computer to run on their Macintosh line of personal computers. Mac OS X is built on Darwin, an open source Unix-like environment which is based on the BSD source tree, and the Mach microkernel.",
	"Mac OS: Macintosh Operating System - Macintosh operating system (Mac OS). is a series of graphical user interface-based operating systems developed by Apple Computer for their Macintosh line of computer systems. It was first introduced in 1984 with the original Macintosh 128K. Earlier versions of the Mac OS were compatible only with Motorola 68000-based Macintoshes, while later versions were also compatible with the PowerPC (PPC) architecture. Most recently, Mac OS X has become compatible with Intel's PC CPU architecture."
