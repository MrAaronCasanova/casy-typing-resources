	"PowerBASIC - PowerBASIC is a dialect of the BASIC programming language, based on the Turbo Basic. Its syntax is similar to that of FreeBasic, GW Basic, QBasic and Turbo Basic. PowerBASIC compilers compile to a pure binary form (native code), without an interpreter at all involved. PowerBASIC programs also don't require any external DLLs to run (unless the programmer deliberately designs them to do so). The executable files they create are almost as compact as those written directly in Assembly Language, run fast, and require no runtime files. Unlike Visual Basic (for example) with its large runtime overhead, it is common for a sophisticated application written in PowerBASIC to be so small that it fits on a diskette.",
	"PPM: Project Portfolio Management - Project portfolio management (PPM) refers to a software package that enables corporate and business users to organize a series of projects into a single portfolio that will provide reports based on the various project objectives, costs, resources, risks and other pertinent associations.

	"PRE: Partial Redundancy Elimination - Partial redundancy elimination (PRE) is a compiler optimization that eliminates expressions that are redundant on some but not necessarily all paths through a program. PRE is a form of common subexpression elimination (CSE).",
	"Preemptive - Preemptive is a practice of an operating system if it allows the running task to be suspended when a task of higher priority becomes ready (or a task of equal priority is granted a turn). Non-preemptive schedulers are easier to be implemented but less appropriate for embedded systems, which must be responsive to external events",
	"Pre-Emptive Multitasking - Pre-emptive multitasking, also known as preemptive multithreading, is a form of multitasking where the scheduler can interrupt and suspend (\"swap out\") the currently running task in order to start or continue running (\"swap in\") another task. The tasks under pre-emptive multitasking can be written as though they were the only task and the scheduler decides when to swap them. The scheduler must ensure that when swapping tasks, sufficient state is saved and restored that tasks do not interfere. Preemptive multitasking allows the computer system to more reliably guarantee each process a regular \"slice\" of operating time. It also allows the system to rapidly deal with important external events like incoming data, which might require the immediate attention of oneor another process.",

	"Priority Inversion - Priority inversion is the scenario in which a high-priority task is delayed while waiting for access to a shared resource that is not even being used at the time. This causes the execution of the high priority task to be blocked until the low priority task has released the resource, effectively \"inverting\" the relative priorities of the two tasks. If some other medium priority task attempts to run in the interim, it will take precedence over both the low priority task and the high priority task.",

	"Profiler - In computer programming, a profiler is a performance analysis tool that measures the behavior of a program as it runs, particularly the frequency and duration of function calls. The output is a stream of recorded events (a trace) or a statistical summary of the events observed (a profile). These statistics include the number of calls to each subroutine and the total amount of time spent within each. This data can be used to learn which subroutines are the most critical and, therefore, demand the greatest code efficiency. Profilers use a wide variety of techniques to collect data, including hardware interrupts, code instrumentation, operating system hooks, and performance counters.",

	"Register Spilling - Register spilling occurs during a program compilation where there are more live variables than the register can hold. When a compiler is generating machine code and there are more live variables than the machine has registers, it has to transfer or \"spill\" some variables from registers to memory. This incurrs at certain cost, as access from memory is typically slower than access from a register.",
	"Regression Testing - Regression testing is any type of software testing which seeks to uncover regression bugs. Regression bugs occur whenever software functionality that previously worked as desired stops working or no longer works in the same way that was previously planned. Typically regression bugs occur as an unintended consequence of program changes.

	"Relational Database - A relational database is a database structured in accordance with the relational model. Strictly speaking the term refers to a specific collection of data but it is invariably employed together with the software used to manage that collection of data. That software is more correctly called a relational database management system (RDBMS). Relational database management systems incorporate many features from the relational model, but commercial RDBMSs also tend to diverge from the relational model in significant ways.",
	"Relational Model - The relational model, a mathematical model invented by Edgar Codd, is a data model for database management based on predicate logic and set theory. The fundamental assumption of the relational model is that all data is represented as mathematical n-ary relations, an n-ary relation being a subset of the Cartesian product of n domains. In the mathematical model, reasoning about such data is done in two-valued predicate logic, meaning there are two possible evaluations for each proposition: either true or false (and in particular, no third value such as unknown, or not applicable, either of which is often associated with the concept of NULL). Some think that logic (which is inherently two-valued) is an important part of the relational model, where others think that a system that uses a form of three-valued logic can still be considered relational.",

Programs stored on non-volatile storage built from integrated circuits (e.g. ROM or PROM) are usually called firmware.",
	"SAA: Systems Application Architecture - Systems Application Architecture(SAA) is a set of interfaces, programming languages, and procedure libraries, guidelines, and protocols developed by IBM to encourage the development of software that is consistent regardless of hardware or operating system.",
	"Sandbox - Sandbox is a testing environment used by many program systems with limited access and resources usage. It is a protective mechanism used by some programming environments to test additons of pre-launched codes or to-be published contents.",
	"Sandwich Test - Sandwich Test refers to a type of software integration test that combines bottom-up testing and top-down testing.",
	"SAPI: Scheduling Application Programming Interface - Scheduling Application Programming Interface(SAPI) is an application programming interface for business scheduling software such as Microsoft Schedule+.",
	"SAPI: Speech Application Programming Interface - Speech Application Programming Interface(SAPI) is an application programming interface (API) from Microsoft that enables speech synthesis and speech recognition programs to communicate with the Windows operating systems. A number of versions of the SAPI have been released, which have shipped either as part of a Speech SDK, or as part of the Windows OS itself. Applications that use SAPI include Microsoft Office, Microsoft Agent and Microsoft Speech Server.",
	"SCADA: Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition - SSupervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) is a system that collects data from sensors locally or in remote locations and sends them to a central computer for management and control. SCADA systems are used in industrial and civil engineering applications to control distributed systems from a master location. SCADA is a very broad umbrella that describes solutions across a large variety of industries, including but not limited to the following: * Electric power generation, transmission and distribution* Environmental control systems* Traffic signals* Water management systems* Mass transit systems* Manufacturing systems",
	"SCANDISK - SCANDISK or Scandisk is a command in DOS and Microsoft Windows systems which verifies hard disk or floppy disk for file system integrity. It is similar to fsck command in Unix. Under Windows 2000 and Windows XP, CHKDSK has replaced SCANDISK for checking disk surface for bad sectors and fixing errors.",
	"SCCS: Source Code Control System - Source Code Control System (SCCS) was the first source code revision control system, originally developed at Bell Labs in 1972 for an IBM System/370 computer running OS/MVT, and was later ported to a PDP-11 running Unix. Today, SCCS is generally considered obsolete.",
	"Scientific Computing - Scientific computing, also known as computational science, is the field of study concerned with constructing mathematical models and numerical solution techniques and using computers to analyze and solve scientific and engineering problems. In practical use, it is typically the application of computer simulation and other forms of computation to problems in various scientific disciplines such as Physics.",
	"SCM: Software Configuration Management - Software Configuration Management (SCM), part of configuration management (CM), is a set of activities designed to control change by identifying the software work products that are likely to change, establishing relationships among them, defining mechanisms for managing different versions of these work products, controlling the changes imposed, and auditing and reporting on the changes made. In other words, SCM is a methodology to control and manage a software development project.",
	"SCM: Source Configuration Management - Source configuration management (SCM) is often used to indicate that a variety of artifacts may be managed and versioned, including software code, documents, design models, and even the directory structure itself. It is part of the Software Configuration Management.",
	"Screen Scraper - Screen scraper is a type of software that allows a PC to intercept character-based data from a mainframe and present it in an easier to understand graphical user interface (GUI ). Newer screen scrapers present the information in HTML, so it can be accessed with a browser. The key element that distinguishes screen scraping from regular parsing is that the output being scraped was nominally intended for human consumption, not machine interpretation. There are a number of synonyms for screen scraping, including: Data scraping, data extraction, web scraping, page scraping, web page wrapping and HTML scraping (the last four being specific to scraping web pages).",
	"ScreenCam - ScreenCam is an early Screencast program from Lotus that can be used to make movies demonstrating how software works by moving through actions on the screen.Voice can be added, and a ScreenCam player can be included with the movie file so that it runs by itself."
