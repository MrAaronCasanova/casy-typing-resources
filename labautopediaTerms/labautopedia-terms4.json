	"DOOM - DOOM is a 1993 computer game by id Software that is among the landmark titles in the first-person shooter genre. It is widely recognized for its pioneering use of immersive 3D graphics, networked multiplayer gaming, and the support for players to create custom expansions (WADs). Distributed as shareware, Doom was downloaded by an estimated 10 million people within two years, popularizing the mode of gameplay and spawning a gaming subculture; as a sign of its impact on the industry, games from the mid-1990s boom of first-person shooters are often known simply as \"Doom clones\". Its graphic and interactive violence has also made Doom the subject of much controversy reaching outside the gaming world.",
	"Doom WAD - Doom WADs (Where's All the Data?) are mods for the computer game Doom or its sequel Doom II. Immediately after its release in 1993, Doom attracted a sizeable following of players who created their own WAD files packages containing levels, graphics and other game data and played a vital part in spawning the mod-making culture which is now commonplace for first-person shooters. Literally thousands of WADs, ranging from single custom levels to full original games, have been created for Doom; most of these can be downloaded for free over the Internet. Several WADs have also been released commercially, and for some people the WAD-making hobby became a gateway to a professional career as a level designer.",

Of these, MS-DOS from Microsoft was the most widely used. These operating systems ran on IBM PC type hardware using the Intel x86 CPUs or their compatible cousins from other makers. Such a system must handle physical disk I/O, the mapping of file names to disk addresses and protection of files from unauthorised access (in a multi-user system).

Emphasis is typically placed on functions or operators â€” an evaluation strategy defines when and in what order the arguments to a function are evaluated, when they are substituted into the function, and what form that substitution takes. A language may combine several evaluation strategies; for example, C++ combines call-by-value with call-by-reference. Most languages that are predominantly strict use some form of non-strict evaluation for boolean expressions and if-statements.",
	"Exec Shield - Exec Shield is a security patch for the Linux kernel that adds an NX bit to x86 CPUs. It was developed by Ingo Molnar of Red Hat, and is used as a part of Fedora Core 1, 2 and 3. Exec Shield attempts to flag data memory as non-executable and program memory as non-writeable.

	"FTP Client - FTP client is a software installed on a workstation which uses the FTP protocol to connect to an FTP server to transfer files. Basic FTP clients are part of operating systems, including Windows, DOS, Linux and Unix. However, many enhanced clients are available typically as shareware/freeware for Windows and as free software for Unix-like systems. Many web browsers have built-in FTP clients as well. Commercial FTP clients also exist with high performance or advanced features.",
	"Functional Programming - Functional programming is a programming paradigm that conceives computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids state and mutable data. Functional programming emphasizes the application of functions, in contrast to imperative programming, which emphasizes changes in state and the execution of sequential commands. Functional programming is defined more by a set of common concerns and themes than any list of distinctions from other paradigms. Often considered important are higher-order and first-class functions, closures, and recursion. Other common features of functional programming languages are continuations, Hindley-Milner type inference systems, non-strict evaluation (including, but not limited to, \"laziness\"), and monads.",
	"Functional Programming Language - Functional programming languages, based on the functional programming paradigm, is a type of programming languages that consist of a set of (possibly recursive) function definitions and an expression whose value is output as the program's result. Functional programing languages are one kind of declarative language. They are based on the typed lambda calculus with constants. There are no side-effects to expression evaluation so an expression. Furthermore, an expression can always be replaced by its value without changing the overall result (referential transparency). Functional programming languages have largely been emphasized in academia rather than in commercial software development. Notable exceptions are Erlang (highly-concurrent telecom applications), J and K (financial analysis), and domain-specific programming languages like XSLT. Important influences on functional programming have been the lambda calculus, the APL programming language, the Lisp programming language, and more recently the Haskell programming language.",
	"GA: Global Arrays - The Global Arrays (GA) is a public domain toolkit that provides an efficient and portable shared-memory programming interface for distributed-memory computers. Unlike other shared-memory environments, the GA model exposes to the programmer the non-uniform memory access (NUMA) characteristics of the high performance computers and acknowledges that access to a remote portion of the shared data is slower than to the local portion. The locality information for the shared data is available, and a direct access to the local portions of shared data is provided. Global Arrays have been designed to complement rather than substitute for the message-passing programming model. The programmer is free to use both the shared-memory and message-passing paradigms in the same program, and to take advantage of existing message-passing software libraries. Global Arrays are compatible with the Message Passing Interface (MPI).",

	"GCC: GNU Compiler Collection - The GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) is a set of programming language compilers produced by the GNU Project. It is free software distributed by the Free Software Foundation (FSF) under the GNU GPL and GNU LGPL, and is a key component of the GNU toolchain. It is the standard compiler for the free software Unix-like operating systems, and several proprietary operating systems, notably Apple Mac OS X. Originally named the GNU C Compiler, because it only handled the C programming language, GCC was later extended to compile C++, Objective-C, Java, Fortran, and Ada among others.",
	"GCJ: GNU Compiler for Java - The GNU Compiler for Java (GCJ) is a compiler for the Java programming language that is part of the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC). It can compile Java source code to either Java Virtual Machine bytecode, or directly to machine code for any of a number of CPU architectures. It can also compile class files containing bytecode or entire Java archives (JARs) containing such class files into machine code. Almost all of the runtime library used by GCJ come from the GNU Classpath project.",
	"GDB: GNU Debugger - GNU Debugger (GDB) is the standard debugger for the GNU software system.
