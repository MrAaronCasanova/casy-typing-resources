	"Callback - In computer programming, a callback is executable code that is passed as an argument to other code. It allows a lower-level software layer to call a function defined in a higher-level layer. Usually, the higher-level code starts by calling a function within the lower-level code passing to it a pointer or handle to another function. While the lower-level function executes, it may call the passed-in function any number of times to perform some subtask. In another scenario, the lower-level function registers the passed-in function as a handler that is to be called asynchronously by the lower-level at a later time in reaction to something. A callback can be used as a simpler alternative to polymorphism and generic programming, in that the exact behavior of a function can be dynamically determined by passing different (yet compatible) function pointers or handles to the lower-level function. This can be a very powerful technique for code reuse.",

	"Casting Variable - Casting Variable in computer programming simply means reassigning the type of a variable. When casting a variable from one type to another, all you are doing is telling the computer to use a different type to store the variable. For example, you declared a variable of type short. In most cases, that would mean that the largest positive value you could store would be 32,767. But somewhere in your program, you realize that you're going to have to do a calculation which could increase the value over this maximum. In this case, you need to perform casting variable.",
	"CATIA - CATIA is the CAD/CAM/CAE commercial software suite developed by Dassault Systemes and marketed world-wide by IBM. It is commonly referred to as a 3D PLM software. All stages of product development are supported, from conceptualization, through design (CAD) and manufacturing (CAM) until analysis (CAE). It provides an open development architecure through interfaces which can be used to customize or develop applications. The API's are supported in Fortran and C for V4 and Visual Basic and C++ for V5. These API's are called CAA2 (or CAA V5). The CAA2 are COM based interfaces. These interfaces provide a seamless integration for products developed on the CATIA suite of software.",
