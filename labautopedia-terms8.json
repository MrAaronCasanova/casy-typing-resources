	"OATH: Object-Oriented Abstract Type Hierarchy - Object-oriented Abstract Type Hierarchy (OATH) is a class library for C++ from Texas Instruments.",
	"Object - Generally, Object refers to any item that can be individually selected and manipulated. In computer programming such as object-oriented programming, an object is an individual unit of run-time data storage that is used as the basic building block of programs. These objects act on each other, as opposed to a traditional view in which a program may be seen as a collection of functions, or simply as a list of instructions to the computer. Each object is capable of receiving messages, processing data, and sending messages to other objects. Each object can be viewed as an independent little machine or actor with a distinct role or responsibility.",
	"Object code - Object code, also known as object file, is an intermediate representation of code generated by a compiler after it processes a source code file. Object files contain compact, pre-parsed code, often called binaries, that can be linked with other object files to generate a final executable or code library. An object file is mostly machine code that can be directly executed by a computer's CPU. An object file contains not only the object code, but also relocation information that the linker uses to assemble multiple object files into an executable or library, program symbols (names of variables and functions), and debugging information.",
	"Object Model - An object model is a subkind of data model with primitive concepts identity, state, encapsulation, operations/methods, messages, inheritance, polymorphism/overloading. An object model deals to the properties of objects in general, in a specific computer programming language, technology, notation or methodology that uses them. For example, the Java object model, the COM object model, or the object model of OMT. Such object models are usually defined using concepts such as class, message, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation. There is an extensive literature on formalized object models as a subset of the formal semantics of programming languages.",
	"Object Database - Object database refers to a type of database in which information is represented in the form of objects. The database management system for an object database is referred to variously as a ODBMS or OODBMS. Object database technologies becomes useful when: 1) a relational database becomes cumbersome to be used with complex data; 2) data is generally manipulated by application software written using object-oriented programming languages and tools such as C++, Java, Borland Delphi and C#, and the code needed to translate between this representation of the data, and the tuples of a relational database can be tedious to write and time-consuming to execute.",
	"Object Pool - An object pool is a set of initialised objects that are kept ready to use, rather than allocated and destroyed on demand. A client of the pool will request an object from the pool and perform operations on the returned object. When the client has finished with an object, it returns it to the pool, rather than destroying it. It is a specific type of factory object. Object pooling can offer a significant performance boost; it is most effective in situations where the cost of initializing a class instance is high, the rate of instantiation of a class is high, and the number of instantiations in use at any one time is low.",
	"Object-SQL Mapping - Object-SQL mapping, also known as object-relational mapping(O/RM), is a programming technique that links SQL databases to object-oriented language concepts, creating (in effect) a \"virtual object database.\" There are both free and commercial packages available that perform object-SQL mapping, although some programmers opt to code their own object-SQL mapping for their systems.",

	"ODBC: Open Database Connectivity - Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) is a common framework for accessing and altering the contents of databases. It allows developers to use the same coding conventions regardless of the actual database platform implemented on the backend. When a new database type is installed, administrators merely need to install an ODBC driver that supports that platform and existing ODBC software should function normally. ODBC provides a standard software API method for using database management systems (DBMS). The designer of ODBC aimed to make it independent of programming language, database system and operating system.",
	"ODBMS: Object Database Management System - Object Database Management System (ODBMS), also known as Object Oriented Database Management System (OODBMS), refers to the database management system for an object database. Benchmarks between ODBMSs and relational DBMSs have shown that ODBMS can be clearly superior for certain kinds of tasks. The main reason for this is that many operations are performed using navigational rather than declarative interfaces, and navigational access to data is usually implemented very efficiently by following pointers. Critics of ODBMS, suggest that pointer-based techniques are optimized for very specific \"search routes\" or viewpoints. However, for general-purpose queries on the same information, pointer-based techniques will tend to be slower and more difficult to formulate than relational.",

	"OOP: Object-Oriented Programming - Object-oriented programming(OOP) is a computer programming paradigm, in which writing programs in one of a class of programming languages and techniques based on the concept of an \"object\" which is a data structure (abstract data type) encapsulated with a set of routines, called \"methods\" which operate on the data. Operations on the data can only be performed via these methods, which are common to all objects which are instances of a particular \"class\".
